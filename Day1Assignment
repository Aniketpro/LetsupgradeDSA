a = 1
b = 1
while(b <= n)
{
    a += 1;
    b += a;
    printf("Hi LetsUpgraders");
}

The code will run for each value of b
till it reaches n

It will run for valuse like 1,3,6,10,15,21,...

Suppose it runs for some time k
So O(k)
Here, k = n-c
c : constant number of terms that will b
skipped between 1 to n

So, ignoring the constant
T(n) = O(n)
